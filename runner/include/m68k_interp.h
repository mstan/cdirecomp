/*
 * m68k_interp.h — Tier-3 clean-room 68000 interpreter (the floor).
 *
 * This is the runtime correctness floor for the static recompiler: when an
 * indirect dispatch reaches an address that was NOT statically discovered
 * (a "dispatch miss"), the native build today silently no-ops it. This
 * interpreter runs that missed function CORRECTLY instead, then the
 * coverage-manifest layer records it so a future regen folds it into the
 * statically-recompiled Tier-1 set.
 *
 * Design (mirrors psxrecomp's "interpreter parallels the codegen" insight,
 * minus the JIT Genesis doesn't need):
 *   - It REUSES the recompiler's own decoder (recompiler/src/m68k_decoder.c),
 *     so operand/EA/immediate parsing is parity-by-construction with the
 *     static C emitter.
 *   - Its per-mnemonic semantics MIRROR recompiler/src/code_generator.c
 *     exactly (same flag formulas, same EA math, same size masking).
 *   - It operates on the SAME runtime ABI the generated C uses: the global
 *     g_cpu (M68KState) and the m68k_read/write{8,16,32} bus.
 *   - It is validated against clown68000 (the AGPL oracle, dev-only) via a
 *     same-state differential before it is trusted — 0 divergences required.
 *
 * Safety contract (precision over recall): the interpreter is the floor, so
 * it cannot "decline" like a JIT. Any instruction it cannot execute must HALT
 * LOUDLY (M68KI_HALT_UNIMPL) rather than silently mis-execute. A partial
 * interpreter is therefore safe — it stops and reports, never corrupts state.
